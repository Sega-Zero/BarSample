# BarSample
Sample project demonstrating implementation of own In-Call bar under statusbar. See [my question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/38738195/1254172) at Stack Overflow.

Master branch contains code that demonstrates own call bar that is visible even if In-Call bar is currently on top.</br>
If you need to hide bar when In-Call is displayed, take a look at [hideable-bar branch](https://github.com/Sega-Zero/BarSample/tree/hideable-bar)

Pull requests are welcomed!
